class Solution:
  def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    points.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
    arrows = 1 # why 1> arrow has to be shot to start the process
    current_end = points[0][1] # first elem of 0th sub array
    for start, end in points: # compare start of every sub array and current_end 
      if start > current_end: # 1 > 6 no 2 > 6 no 7 > 6 (yes) current end = 12 (6,12) res++
        current_end = end
        arrows += 1
    return arrows

# sort balloons in ascending order and think of shooting end point of first balloon in order to maximise bursting of all balloons with min arrows
