'''
Documentaion
  Should be boundary on left and right both and the area between them counts
  In order for boundary -> we must take minimum. 1 _ 2 -> _ can't be 2 (left boundary is 1, water will fall. take min(l, r) -> 1 unit)
  Take min(maximum left height, maximum right height) - height[current index we're at]
  No Water Trapped : min(l, r) - h[i] for ith position -> min(1,3), h[i] = 2, -> 1 - 2 = -1 (Can't trap neg number -> 0)
  Water Trapped : current height = 1, max_left = 2, max_right = 3, min(2,3) = 2 - 1 (height[i]) -> Trap 1 unit water in that position
  ---
  Find maxLeft, maxRight -> min(maxLeft, maxRight) -> How much water we can trap in that position
  For every single position -> Find how much water can be trapped for that position -> min(maxLeft, maxRight) - height[current_position]
