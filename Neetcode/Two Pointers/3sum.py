# https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

# Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
# Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
# Explanation: 
  # nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
  # nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
  # nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
# The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].

Documentation
  Pick first number (make sure it's not duplicate)
  Apply twosum for other 2 numbers.
  Skip duplicates. (for both 2nd and 3rd number)

We then enter 2 more loops. These loops are used to bypass duplicates. 
The first one continues while low < high and also while the element at the current pointer position equals the element at the next pointer position. 
We move the left pointer forwards until a unique element is found.

Notes : Look how to skip duplicates || work on it on paper.
