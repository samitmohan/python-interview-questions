# https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/

# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
# Output: [1,2]

class Solution:
  def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
      hashmap = {}
      for x in nums:
          if x not in hashmap:
          # add 
            hashmap[x] = 1 # count
          else:
            # already in hashmap -> increase count
            hashmap[x] += 1 
        # now we have dictionary with key(number) value(freq) pairs 
        # sort the list based on values (highest first) -> return first k elements.
      answer = sorted(hashmap, key = hashmap.get, reverse = True) [:k]#  sorting in reverse order and getting the keys, sliced for k times.
      return answer
