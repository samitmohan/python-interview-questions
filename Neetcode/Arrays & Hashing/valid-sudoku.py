# https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/

# Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

# Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

'''
Documentation
  -> Keep a hashmap (set) and put all values of box in it, then check if it repeats for every row/column -> if it does -> not valid
  -> Check for every row (9) for every col (9) and also for every square,
  Defining Square
    instead of 0 1 2 .. 9 -> label them as 0 1 2 (col and rows), and to calc just // -> 4 row 4 col -> 4 // 3, 4 // 3 -> [1, 1] -> check at 1, 1

Time Complexity -> Hashsets for columns, rows, and each 3x3 square, O(1) time to check, iterating through the entire board (9*9) -> O(81)
